I told her that was crazy -- Facebook ads were just a way for Mark Zuckerberg to make more money. I had so many suspicions. I did not want to get taken for a ride. I knew plenty of artists that had Facebook pages but were not experiencing any positive financial impact on their business. I decided to find out for myself if Facebook marketing could really work for artists and craftspeople.</p>

I found other artists who were successfully using Facebook to sell their work on their websites. I found small mom-and-pop businesses who were watching their sales skyrocket using Facebook to drive sales. I subscribed to Facebook marketing blogs and podcasts, and read and listened religiously. During the past two years I became addicted to Facebook marketing. I've spent over $10,000 taking Facebook marketing courses and seminars.

                                <p>To say that Facebook marketing has changed my life would be an understatement! Today, 90% of my internet sales come directly from my Facebook marketing efforts - <strong>90%!</strong> I have had a 1000% increase <strong>(you read that right, One Thousand Percent Increase)</strong> in my online sales since I started with Facebook Marketing. This dramatic increase in my online sales has allowed me to go from 30 shows per year down to 5. Suffice it to say, I am no longer suspicious.</p>

                                            <p>Everything suddenly seemed so much clearer to me and as I started to implement some small changes to my page my flatlining starts took to life and were peaking all over the place! I am MORE than amazed and grateful to now be on a great FB path to success and you know what - more than that - FB is now a sweet thing for me. I have authentic and rich connections with artists and students and the whole scene is responsive and also bringing me more income. This has been pivotal for me. I would get on this course - you will not regret it.</p>

                                        I have been an artist for over 27 years and I was fed up with the year-after-year grind of the show circuit, with everyone taking your money before you even have a hint of profit. I was tired of the rising booth fees, the hotel costs going through the roof, the cost of travel, food, and the hassle of sales tax collection, the list goes on and on. It seems like everyone was getting a piece of the pie and I was left with the crumbs. Then one day my daughter encouraged me to investigate Facebook marketing. The deeper I looked into Facebook the more I believed I could use this social media platform for marketing my business. After hundreds of hours of study, and months and months of trial and error, I perfected a Facebook marketing strategy that worked and my online sales exploded. I started sharing what I was doing with my artist friends, and teaching them what I had learned. They encouraged me to put all of the details down and create an online course so that others could benefit from what I could teach them. There is an extremely more profitable way to sell your work. I created this course with a commitment to getting you results. It's a results-driven course for serious people.​

                                        Facebook is by far the number one social media platform in the world. Today, more than 90% of my online sales come from my Facebook marketing efforts. The impact of social media transcends almost every aspect of our daily lives—work, politics, breaking news, and more. The rise in social media usage by smart business owners, and your audience means that participation is no longer an option; it’s a necessity for building and driving your sales.
