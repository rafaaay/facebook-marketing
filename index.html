I knew plenty of artists that had Facebook pages but were not experiencing any positive financial impact on their business. I decided to find out for myself if Facebook marketing could really work for artists and craftspeople.</p>

                                <p>I pored over reviews and data of legitimate companies who were successfully using Facebook for their marketing. I found other artists who were successfully using Facebook to sell their work on their websites. I found small mom-and-pop businesses who were watching their sales skyrocket using Facebook to drive sales. I subscribed to Facebook marketing blogs and podcasts, and read and listened religiously. During the past two years I became addicted to Facebook marketing. I've spent over $10,000 taking Facebook marketing courses and seminars. As I started implementing everything I was learning, <strong>my internet sales soared!</strong></p>
